00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:04,458
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

Hmm. Sounds more like your type.

Fine. I've got the shield.
You've got the sword.

No, don't. Stop right there.

Bernard in accounting

I read about it in your biography.
I hope you like it.

for a mission that is both
highly dangerous and absolutely necessary

90
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,000
for the continuation of life
as you know it.

91
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,625
At first, I scoured eternity
for one true hero.

92

Then I saw the bigger picture.

93
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,791
This mission requires a team.

00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,916
The perfect combination of skills
and experience that alone will triumph.

Let me get this straight.

96
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,083
You kidnapped us from across the galaxy
so we could, what?

97
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,375
Save the universe?

98
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,875
Mmm. Not exactly.

99
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,583
Bit more complicated than that.

100
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,666
You aren't just our best hope
to save one universe.

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,791
You are my last hope to save all of them.

102
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,375
You are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

103
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,291
I know what this is.
Loki put you up to this joke.

104

Listen, I do not have time
for his pranks today.

105

No, I wouldn't do that.

what we're up against?

THE WATCHER: Your worlds are either
under attack or soon will be by Ultron,

an artificial intelligence
elevated to a cosmic being

112
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,000
thanks to an enhanced synthetic body
and the power of the Infinity Stones.

113

DR. STRANGE: Six stones
of near unfathomable power.

114

Each controlling
an essential aspect of our existence.

115
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,083
And Ultron holds all of them.

116
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,375
I might be able to help with that.
I've stolen more from worse.

117
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
Seriously?
You really are from another planet.

118
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:48,083
We believe the only way to stop Ultron
is to separate his body from the stones.

119
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,375
But this Ultron could be hiding
anywhere in the Multiverse?

120
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,041
-Yes.
-Behind an army of killer robots?

121
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,791
-Afraid so.
-And armed with a full set of stones?

00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,208
-She's got a point.
-I never said it would be easy.

123
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,625
This is a suicide mission.

You picked them.

128
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, obviously the first step
would be finding him.

129
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,083
Well, I'm not one to brag,

130
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:18,208
but I've been told that I excel
at attracting unwanted attention.

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,958
Oh. That will come in handy.

132
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
And after we recover the stones,
we destroy them.

133
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,083
How would you even
go about destroying the...

134
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,333
Oh, you're answering my question.
Sorry. Thank you.

135
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,916
GAMORA: The Infinity Crusher,

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,958
designed to disintegrate each stone
into nothing.

137
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,125
Yep. I picked them.

138
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,875
All right, everyone, you all know
what to do. You know the plan.

139
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,791
Get the Soul Stone and get it to Gamora.

140
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,500
We'll hold the line.
And then she'll unleash the Crusher.

141
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,416
With some luck, we'll be home for dinner.

142
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,083
Okay, wait. Slow down a little bit.

143
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,458
There's a few people in the room
that don't understand.

144
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,208
Not me. I get it.
But for them, maybe repeat it.

145
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,541
Hmm. You're ready.
It's showtime, my friends. Good luck.

146
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,916
This place is safe?

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,666
Apparently, there's not enough
intelligent life here to attract Ultron.

148
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,333
Until we decide to.

-Can I ask, what happened?
-(SIGHS)

152
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,958
Same thing that happened to you. Love.

153
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,375
I take it you know the Captain Carter
on your universe?

154
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,708
No. Captain America.

155
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,708
In my universe,
Steve Rogers received the serum.

156
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,166
Now, that would be a sight to see.

157
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,833
You trust him?

158
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,166
I trust everyone.

159
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:57,250
Hasten, friends. Tonight we feast.
For tomorrow, we fight.

160
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,500
In that spirit, I propose a toast.

-THOR: Some mead. Wonderful.
-GAMORA: Ooh. Now we're talking.

00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:07,208
A wise sorcerer once told me
that to face death is part of the plan.

163
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:12,125
To face death is to conquer
one's greatest fear of the unknown

164
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,875
of nothingless space,
of the end of all ends.

165

The senseless nothing and the vast
opening of infinity to your...

166
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,083
Let me. You've done enough, Doctor.

167
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,625
To the Guardians of...

168
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,458

(ECHOING) The Multiverse!

So there is life
in this universe, after all.

171
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,833

00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,500
Someone needs to attend to them.

352
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,125
If that pocket dimension cracks,
if they escape--

353
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,416
I'll watch.

354
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,583
I have nothing but time.

355
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,083
Thank you, Stephen.

356
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,666
Mmm. And besides, what are friends for?

357
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,750
THE WATCHER:<i> The entire Multiverse</i>
<i>owes you a debt of gratitude.</i>

358
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,375
But your worlds will never know
this victory.

359
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,333
Once you walk through that door,

360
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,958
you'll return
to the exact moment you left.

361
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,708
It's time to go, Captain.

362
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,958
You'd rather return to another time.

363
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,916
Haven't I earned my happy ending?

364
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:43,375
Trust me, that world, that time,

365
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,583
needs Captain Carter.

366
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,250
And then there was one.

367
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,750
I won't go back there. My world is...

368
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,708
(BREATHES DEEPLY) gone.

369
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,791
You won, but I lost.

370
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,583
-I cannot in--
-Interfere? Yeah, I know.

371
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,458
We're just stories to you. We're not real.

372
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,958
You watch us fight, win, lose.

373
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:25,666
Tell me, did you make popcorn
while Ultron murdered my friends

374
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,208
and burned my world to the ground?

375
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,500
You are more than that to me.

376
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,583
Are we?

377
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:33,083
You, your stories,

378
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,916
they are everything to me.

379
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,916
Then fix my world.

380
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,000
I can't, Natasha.

381
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,250
I'm not walking through that door.

382
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,500
Well, the door was more
of a metaphor anyway.

383
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,166
(GRUNTING)

384
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,625
Where... Where are we?

385
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,375
On a world that lost their Widow.

386
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,000
It's a mess. (SIGHS)

387
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,708
Thank you.

388
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,666
(GRUNTS) Hmm.

389
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,708
You and your replacement Avengers
fought valiantly,

390
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,583
but now I think it's time
you told me all your secrets.

391
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,291
I was told you were dead.

392
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,208
Same.

393
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,333
(GASPS)

394
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,125
You're not my Natasha,

395
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,000
but something tells me
you have her spirit.

396
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,833
THE WATCHER: <i>That's it, isn't it?</i>

397
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,000
<i>All creatures searching</i>
<i>for a place to belong.</i>

398
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,291
<i>To call home.</i>

399
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,333
As for me, I am the Watcher.

400
00:29:55,916 --> 00:30:01,000
The Multiverse, every single world,
every story is my home,

401
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:04,333
and I will protect it to the end.

402
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

403
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,916
(GRUNTS)

404
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,041
(CHUCKLES) I'm too fast.

405
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,166
(GROANS)

406
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,041
Don't tell me, he was your type?

407
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,875
Oh, Widow, I've never been
so happy to see you.

408
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,041
Did you hit your head or something?

409
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,875
A few times, actually.

410
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,875
Shake it off. You'll need
all your marbles for this one.

411
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,333
I found what the pirates were after.

412
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,375
Peggy, you might wanna brace yourself.

413
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,791
PEGGY: I can promise you, Nat,

414
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,291
this won't be the strangest thing
I've dealt with today.

415
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,291
NATASHA: Famous last words.

416
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,000
PEGGY: The HYDRA Stomper?

417
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,500
Yeah, and there's someone inside.
