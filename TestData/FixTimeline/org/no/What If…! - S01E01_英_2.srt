00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,041
Hedy Lamarr
and I spent a weekend together,

346
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,833
but she wasn't teaching me German!

347
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,625
-Steve?
-Did you miss me?

348
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:01,708
-Every second.
-I told you it was indestructible.

349
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,083
You were saying, Howard?

350
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:12,041
Oh, wow. Who ordered the calamari?

351
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,541
(ROARING)

352
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,875
(SCREAMING)

353
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,041
-Steve!
-ROGERS: On it!

354
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,791
Go get 'em, Steve!

355
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,000
I can't close it!
This thing is holding it open!

356
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,208
Then I'll push it back to hell!

357
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,750
(PEGGY YELLING)

358
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:52,416
(GROANS)

359
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,500
ROGERS: Peggy!

360
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,875
No, no, no!

361
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,375
-Peggy, no!
-I have to. I can end this.

362
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,708
You owe me a dance lesson.

363
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,958
Yes, Saturday night.

364
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,083
(GRUNTS)

365
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,291
(GASPS)

366
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,416
-FURY: Ma'am.
-(PEGGY GRUNTS)

367
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,166
Please, put down the sword.

368
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,291
Uh, sir? That's Captain Carter.

369
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,791
Where's Steve Rogers?

370
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:35,041
The war ended almost 70 years ago.

371
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,625
FURY: You going to be okay?

372
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,000
Of course.

373
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,750
We won the war.

374
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,166
WATCHER: Her one choice
gave birth to a whole new history

375
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,250
and gave the multiverse a new hero.

376
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,500
As for me, these are my stories.

377
00:28:56,583 --> 00:29:02,666
I observe all that transpires here,
but I do not, cannot, will not interfere.

378
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,125
For I am...

379
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,625
the Watcher.
